# Project Brief: MCP Server Elixir Library

## 1. Project Goal

To develop an Elixir library that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server specification. The library should be designed for easy integration with existing Elixir web applications, particularly those using the Plug and Phoenix frameworks.

## 2. Core Requirements

*   **MCP Specification Adherence:** Implement all mandatory features of the MCP server specification.
*   **Plug Integration:** Provide a Plug that can be easily mounted in Plug-based applications (including Phoenix).
*   **User-Friendly API:** Offer a clear and idiomatic Elixir API for developers to implement their MCP server logic (e.g., defining resources, tools, prompts). This will be achieved through a behaviour (`MCPServer.Implementation`).
*   **State Management:** Manage connection-specific state (e.g., client capabilities) using a GenServer (`MCPServer.Connection`).
*   **Configuration:** Allow configuration of the MCP Plug (e.g., specifying the handler module).
*   **Extensibility:** Design the library to be extensible for future MCP features or custom user needs.
*   **Elixir Best Practices:** Follow common Elixir coding standards, including documentation, testing, and error handling.

## 3. Target Audience

Elixir developers who want to integrate MCP capabilities into their applications.

## 4. Scope

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Core MCP server logic (JSON-RPC request handling, dispatch to user-defined handlers).
    *   `MCPServer.Implementation` behaviour for user callbacks.
    *   `MCPServer.Connection` GenServer for managing connection state.
    *   `MCPServer.Plug` for HTTP integration.
    *   `MCPServer.Context` struct for passing contextual information to handlers.
    *   Support for standard JSON parsing (using Elixir's built-in `JSON` module).
    *   Basic error handling and JSON-RPC response formatting.
    *   Documentation and examples.
    *   Unit tests.
*   **Out of Scope (Initially):**
    *   WebSocket transport (can be a future enhancement).
    *   Batch JSON-RPC requests (can be a future enhancement).
    *   Advanced security features beyond what Plug offers by default.
    *   Client-side MCP library.

## 5. Success Criteria

*   The library can be used to create a functional MCP server that passes a basic compliance test (to be defined).
*   The `mcp_server_demo` application successfully demonstrates the library's usage.
*   The library is well-documented and easy for Elixir developers to adopt.
*   The codebase has a reasonable level of test coverage.
