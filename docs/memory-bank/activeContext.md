# Active Context: MCP Server Elixir Library

## 1. Current Work Focus

With the `mcp_server_demo` test suite now passing after a significant refactoring of the JSON-RPC request/response handling in the core `mcp_server` library, the primary focus shifts towards:

*   **Comprehensive Unit Testing for `mcp_server`:**
    *   Thoroughly test `MCPServer.Connection` logic in isolation (method dispatch, state transitions, all MCP method handling, error conditions).
    *   Test `MCPServer.Plug` for request parsing, response generation, options handling, and error paths (e.g., invalid HTTP methods, body read errors).
    *   Verify default implementations in `MCPServer.Implementation`.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Begin writing `@moduledoc` and `@doc` for all public modules and functions in `mcp_server`.
    *   Draft an initial `README.md` for the `mcp_server` library.

## 2. Recent Changes Summary

*   **JSON-RPC Refactoring (`MCPServer.Connection` & `MCPServer.Plug`):**
    *   `MCPServer.Connection` now uses helper functions (`genserver_reply_success/4`, `genserver_reply_error/3`) to ensure consistent and correct JSON-RPC response formatting for all MCP methods. This resolved issues where payloads were not matching `MCPServer.Plug`'s sending clauses.
    *   The structure of the `mcp/initialize` response was corrected to nest capabilities under `\"serverCapabilities\"` and include a `\"sessionId\"` (even if nil).
    *   Error handling in `MCPServer.Plug` for `Plug.Conn.read_body/1` was simplified and made more robust.
    *   An unused `error_resp/4` function was removed from `MCPServer.Connection`.
*   **Test Suite Success (`mcp_server_demo`):**
    *   The test suite in `mcp_server_demo` (both `echo_handler_test.exs` and `echo_handler_integration_test.exs`) is now fully passing.
    *   Assertions were updated to match the corrected response structures (e.g., string keys from JSON decoding, correct nesting of results for list operations, proper `mcp/initialize` response format).
*   **Core Library Implemented:** `MCPServer.Plug`, `MCPServer.Implementation` (behaviour), `MCPServer.Connection` (GenServer), and `MCPServer.Context` (struct) form a stable base.
*   **JSON Handling:** Uses the standard library `JSON` module.
*   **`MCPServer.Context`:** Provides structured context to handler callbacks.

## 3. Next Steps (High-Level)

1.  **Comprehensive Unit Tests for `mcp_server` library (Current Focus).**
2.  **Core Documentation (`@moduledoc`, `@doc`, `README.md`) (Current Focus).**
3.  **Credo Integration:** Add and configure `credo` for static code analysis.
4.  **Refinements & Advanced Features (Post-MVP):**
    *   Consider WebSocket support.
    *   Consider batch JSON-RPC request support.
    *   More robust error handling and logging (e.g., specific error data payloads).

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Testing Strategy:** Having established end-to-end viability with the demo app's tests, the focus is now on granular unit tests for the library itself to ensure robustness and cover edge cases.
*   **`Plug.Conn` in Context:** The decision to pass a map of selected `Plug.Conn` details remains.
*   **GenServer Lifecycle:** Current model (GenServer per request) is sufficient for now.
*   **Dialyzer Warning in `MCPServer.Plug`:** The warning about `Plug.Conn.read_body/1` pattern matching is noted but deemed acceptable for now as functionality is correct.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

*   **Clarity and Simplicity.**
*   **Explicit Error Handling (`{:ok, ...}`, `{:error, ...}`).**
*   **Immutability.**
*   **Test-Driven (Aspirational).**
*   **Minimal Dependencies.**

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights

*   **Iterative Refinement is Key:** The process of getting the demo tests to pass highlighted several areas for improvement in the core library's response handling and data structuring.
*   **Test Suites Drive Quality:** A good test suite is invaluable for uncovering subtle bugs and ensuring refactoring doesn't break existing functionality.
*   **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The `Plug` (HTTP interface), `Connection` (session/state logic), and `Implementation` (user logic) model is working well.
*   Typespecs, `defoverridable`, and careful handling of JSON key types (string vs. atom) continue to be important details.
