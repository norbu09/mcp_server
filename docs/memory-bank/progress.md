# Progress: MCP Server Elixir Library

## 1. What Works

*   **Core Library Structure & Functionality:**
    *   `MCPServer.Plug` correctly handles HTTP requests, parses JSON-RPC, delegates to `MCPServer.Connection`, and sends back formatted JSON-RPC responses.
    *   `MCPServer.Connection` (GenServer) successfully manages handler initialization, state, MCP method dispatch (including `mcp/initialize`), and uses helper functions to correctly format JSON-RPC success and error responses.
    *   `MCPServer.Implementation` (behaviour) and `MCPServer.Context` (struct) are stable and functioning as designed.
*   **JSON Handling:** Uses Elixir 1.18+'s built-in `JSON` module.
*   **Demo Application (`mcp_server_demo`):
    *   `MCPServerDemo.EchoHandler` serves as a working example implementation.
    *   The demo application (`MCPServerDemo.Application`) integrates and runs `MCPServer.Plug` via Bandit.
    *   **The test suite in `mcp_server_demo` (unit and integration tests for `EchoHandler` via `MCPServer.Plug`) is now fully passing.** This verifies the core request/response flow of the `mcp_server` library.
*   **Error Handling:** JSON-RPC errors are generated for parsing issues, invalid requests, and handler-returned errors. `Plug.Conn.read_body` errors are also handled.
*   **Code Quality:** Most known compiler warnings addressed. The `defoverridable` list is correct.

## 2. What's Left to Build (Key Items)

*   **Comprehensive Unit Tests for `mcp_server` library:** This is the highest priority.
    *   Focus on `MCPServer.Connection` (all MCP method dispatch paths, state updates, specific error conditions, `mcp/initialize` variants).
    *   Test `MCPServer.Plug` (option handling, specific error responses for HTTP/Plug issues).
    *   Tests for default implementations in `MCPServer.Implementation`.
*   **Full MCP Method Coverage in `MCPServer.Connection`:** Ensure all remaining optional MCP methods defined in `MCPServer.Implementation` (e.g., related to prompt creation, resource modification if added) are correctly dispatched and results handled.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   `@moduledoc` and `@doc` for all public modules and functions in `mcp_server`.
    *   A detailed `README.md` for the `mcp_server` library.
    *   Review and finalize `docs/mcp_server_elixir_design.md`.
*   **Static Analysis:** Integrate and configure `mix credo`.
*   **Robustness and Edge Cases:**
    *   More specific error types/codes within the JSON-RPC error object's `data` field.
    *   Thoroughly test invalid inputs beyond what the demo tests cover.

## 3. Current Status

*   The library is at a stable alpha stage. Core functionality is robust, and the primary request/response pathways are verified by the demo app's test suite.
*   Ready for focused unit testing of the library components and comprehensive documentation.

## 4. Known Issues

*   **Dialyzer Warning in `MCPServer.Plug`:** A warning persists regarding `Plug.Conn.read_body/1` pattern matching. Functionality is not affected.
*   **`MCPServer.Context.t()` Typespec for `plug_conn`:** Uses `map() | nil`.
*   **GenServer per Request:** Current design. Future consideration for persistent connections if MCP features demand it.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **JSON Library:** Shifted to Elixir's built-in `JSON` module.
*   **Context Passing:** Formalized with `MCPServer.Context`.
*   **JSON-RPC Handling Refinement:** Iteratively improved `MCPServer.Connection` and `MCPServer.Plug` to ensure correct JSON-RPC response structures, driven by test failures in the demo application. This led to the introduction of response formatting helpers in `MCPServer.Connection`.
*   **Test-Driven Refinement:** The `mcp_server_demo` test suite was instrumental in identifying and resolving issues in the core `mcp_server` library's request processing and response generation logic.
