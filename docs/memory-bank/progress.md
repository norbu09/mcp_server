# Progress: MCP Server Elixir Library

## 1. What Works

*   **Core Library Structure:**
    *   `MCPServer.Plug` can receive HTTP requests, parse JSON-RPC, and delegate to `MCPServer.Connection`.
    *   `MCPServer.Connection` (GenServer) can be started, initialize a handler module, dispatch MCP method calls to the handler, manage handler state, and format JSON-RPC responses (success/error).
    *   `MCPServer.Implementation` (behaviour) defines the contract for handler modules, and its `__using__/1` macro correctly injects the behaviour and default implementations for optional callbacks.
    *   `MCPServer.Context` struct is created and passed to handler callbacks, providing relevant request and connection information, including selected details from `Plug.Conn`.
*   **JSON Handling:** Uses Elixir 1.18+'s built-in `JSON` module for encoding and decoding.
*   **Demo Application (`mcp_server_demo`):
    *   `MCPServerDemo.EchoHandler` provides a minimal, working implementation of `MCPServer.Implementation`.
    *   The demo application (`MCPServerDemo.Application`) successfully starts the Bandit web server with `MCPServer.Plug` configured to use `EchoHandler`.
    *   The entire `mcp_server_demo` project compiles, indicating successful integration of the `mcp_server` library.
*   **Basic MCP Flow:** The `mcp/initialize` flow is handled, including calling the handler's `handle_client_capabilities/3` (if implemented, otherwise a default) and returning `server_capabilities`.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic JSON-RPC error responses are generated for parsing errors or when a handler callback returns an `{:error, ...}` tuple.
*   **Code Quality:** Most known compiler warnings have been addressed. The `defoverridable` list in `MCPServer.Implementation` is correct.

## 2. What's Left to Build (Key Items)

*   **Comprehensive Test Suite:** This is the highest priority.
    *   Integration tests for `mcp_server_demo` covering various MCP methods and success/error scenarios.
    *   Unit tests for `MCPServer.Connection` (method dispatch, state updates, error handling, `mcp/initialize` flow).
    *   Unit tests for `MCPServer.Plug` (request parsing, response sending, option handling).
    *   Tests for default implementations in `MCPServer.Implementation`.
*   **Full MCP Method Coverage in `MCPServer.Connection`:** Ensure all MCP methods defined in `MCPServer.Implementation` are correctly dispatched and handled.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   `@moduledoc` and `@doc` for all public modules and functions in `mcp_server`.
    *   A detailed `README.md` for the `mcp_server` library.
    *   Review and finalize `docs/mcp_server_elixir_design.md`.
*   **Static Analysis:** Integrate and configure `mix credo`.
*   **Robustness and Edge Cases:**
    *   More specific error types/codes within the JSON-RPC error object's `data` field.
    *   Thoroughly test invalid inputs, malformed JSON, incorrect MCP methods, etc.
*   **Configuration Options:** Review and potentially expand configuration options for `MCPServer.Plug` (e.g., for logging levels, timeouts if applicable).

## 3. Current Status

*   The library is at an alpha stage. Core functionality is in place and the demo application works.
*   It is ready for initial testing and documentation efforts.
*   The API for `MCPServer.Implementation` and the overall structure are stabilizing.

## 4. Known Issues

*   **Limited Testing:** The lack of an automated test suite is the most significant current gap.
*   **`MCPServer.Context.t()` Typespec for `plug_conn`:** Uses `map() | nil` as a pragmatic workaround for `Plug.Conn.t()`. While functional, it's less precise than desired.
*   **GenServer per Request:** `MCPServer.Connection` is started per request. This is simple but may need re-evaluation for MCP scenarios requiring persistent connections without client-side session management.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **Initial Stub to Core Components:** Started with a user-facing stub (`MyApp.MyMCPServer`), which helped define the `MCPServer.Implementation` behaviour. This evolved into the `Plug` -> `Connection` (GenServer) -> `Implementation` (handler) architecture.
*   **JSON Library:** Shifted from an explicit dependency (Jason) to Elixir 1.18+'s built-in `JSON` module to reduce external dependencies.
*   **Context Passing:** Initially, an empty map or minimal context was passed to handlers. This was formalized into the `MCPServer.Context` struct to provide a richer and more explicit set of information, including sanitized `Plug.Conn` details.
*   **Error Handling in `MCPServer.Implementation`:** The type for `error_object` (`@type error_object :: map()`) was simplified to resolve linter issues. It remains a point for potential future refinement.
*   **`defoverridable`:** The list of overridable functions in `MCPServer.Implementation.__using__/1` was corrected to only include those with default implementations, which fixed compilation errors in the demo project.
